# Barefoot

An open source Java library for online and offline map matching with OpenStreetMap. Together with its extensive set of geometric and spatial functions, an in-memory map data structure and basic machine learning functions, it is a versatile basis for scalable location-based services and spatio-temporal data analysis on the map. It is designed for use in parallel and distributed systems and, hence, includes a stand-alone map matching server and can be used in distributed systems for map matching services in the cloud.

#### Flexible and extensive

Barefoot consists of a software library and a (Docker-based) map server that provides access to street map data from OpenStreetMap and is flexible to be used in distributed cloud infrastructures as map data server or side-by-side with Barefoot's stand-alone servers for offline (matcher server) and online map matching (tracker server), or other applications built with Barefoot library. Access to map data is provided with a fast and flexible in-memory map data structure. Together with GeographicLib [1] and ESRI's geometry API [2], it provides an extensive set of geographic and geometric operations for spatial data analysis on the map.

#### State-of-the-art map matching

Barefoot includes a Hidden Markov Model map matching implementation for both, offline map matching as proposed by Newson and Krumm in [3] and online map matching as proposed by Goh et al. in [4]. Offline map matching is the path reconstruction of a moving object from a recorded GPS trace. In contrast, online map matching determines an object's position and movement on the map iteratively from live GPS position updates in real-time.

#### Scalable and versatile

Barefoot is designed for use in parallel and distributed high-throughput systems [5]. For map matching large batches of GPS traces (offline map matching), it can be easily integrated in Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark (see example below), whereas Apache Storm and Apache Spark Streaming provide a runtime environment for processing massive data streams (online map matching). To support other data analysis functions, Barefoot comes with basic machine learning support, e.g., DBSCAN for spatial cluster analysis [6].

#### Open source and open data

Barefoot is licensed under the business-friendly Apache License 2.0 and uses only business-friendly open source software with open map data from OpenStreetMap.

## BAREFOOT-DOCKER-READY

Barefoot is now ready to run with Docker Compose! This is the easiest way to get started with the full stack (Map Server, Matcher Server, and Tracker Server).

### Quick Start

1. **Start all services:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > **Before starting:** You must provide an OpenStreetMap PBF file.
    > 1. Download your desired map region (e.g., from [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/)).
    > 2. Place it at `./map/osm/map.osm.pbf` (or update the volume mapping in `docker-compose.yml` to point to your file).
    > 3. Ensure the file is readable.

    This command will:
    * Pull the latest images from GitHub Container Registry:
        * `ghcr.io/joseedsouza/barefoot/barefoot-map:latest`
        * `ghcr.io/joseedsouza/barefoot/barefoot-matcher:latest`
        * `ghcr.io/joseedsouza/barefoot/barefoot-tracker:latest`
    * Start all three containers in the background.

2. **Access the services:**

    * **Map Server:** Running on port `5438` (mapped to internal `5432`).
    * **Matcher Server:** Running on port `1234`.
    * **Tracker Server:** Running on port `1235` (tracker) and `1236` (state).

3. **Verify:**

    You can check the status of the containers with:

    ```bash
    docker compose ps
    ```

    To view logs:

    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f
    ```

### Building from Source (Local Development)

If you want to build the images locally (e.g., for development or if you've made changes to the code), use the `local.docker-compose.yaml` file:

```bash
docker compose -f local.docker-compose.yaml up -d --build
```

This will build the images from the local context instead of pulling them from the registry.

### Configuration & Features

The `docker-compose.yml` file is pre-configured with sensible defaults, but it's designed to be flexible.

#### 1. Environment Variables

You can configure the servers using environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`. The entrypoint scripts (`docker/matcher/entrypoint.sh` and `docker/tracker/entrypoint.sh`) automatically map these variables to the properties files.

* **Mapping Logic:**
    1. The script looks for variables starting with a specific prefix.
    2. It removes the prefix.
    3. It converts the rest of the name to **lowercase**.
    4. It replaces all underscores `_` with dots `.`.
  * *Example:* `SERVER__MATCHER_THREADS=8` becomes `matcher.threads=8`.

* **Prefixes:**
  * **Matcher Server:**
    * `SERVER__`: Maps to `config/server.properties` (e.g., `SERVER__SERVER_PORT`).
    * `MAP__`: Maps to `config/map.properties`.
  * **Tracker Server:**
    * `TRACKER__`: Maps to `config/tracker.properties` (e.g., `TRACKER__TRACKER_STATE_TTL`).
    * `MAP__`: Maps to `config/map.properties`.

* **Defaults:** The entrypoint scripts check if the configuration files exist. If not, they create them with default values (e.g., `matcher.threads=8`, `database.host=localhost`). This ensures the container runs out-of-the-box.

#### 2. Automatic Map Import

The `map-server` is smart! On the first initialization, if the database is empty, it automatically imports the OpenStreetMap data.

* **Process:**
    1. **Check:** The entrypoint (`map/entrypoint.sh`) checks if the configured database exists.
    2. **Import:** If not, it executes `map/osm/import.sh`.
        * **Database Setup:** Creates the database and installs PostGIS extensions.
        * **Osmosis:** Uses `osmosis` to read the PBF file (`MAP_OSM_PBF_PATH`) and populate the database.
        * **Routing Data:** Uses `osm2ways.py` and `ways2bfmap.py` to extract routing topology and create the `bfmap_ways` table.
    3. **Start:** Finally, it starts the PostgreSQL server in the foreground.

* **Configuration:**
  * `MAP_OSM_PBF_PATH`: Path to the input PBF file (default: `/mnt/data/map.osm.pbf`).
  * `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Database credentials.
  * `MAP_MODE`: Import mode (`slim` or `normal`).

* **Persistence:** The data is stored in the `barefoot-db` volume, so the import only happens once. Subsequent restarts are instant.

#### 3. Port Mapping

The services are exposed on the following ports:

* **Map Server (`5438:5432`):** The PostGIS database is accessible on host port `5438`. This allows you to connect with tools like QGIS or `psql` without conflicts if you have a local Postgres running on 5432.
* **Matcher Server (`1234:1234`):** The API for map matching.
* **Tracker Server:**
  * `1235:1234`: The tracker API port (mapped to internal 1234).
  * `1236:1235`: The tracker state port (mapped to internal 1235).

#### 4. Default Configurations

The base configuration files are located in the `./config` directory of the repository.

* These files (`server.properties`, `map.properties`, etc.) serve as the template.
* The Docker images use these templates and apply the environment variable overrides at runtime.

## Showcases and Quick Starts

### Online and offline HMM map matching

Barefoot provides a HMM map matching solution that can be used via the software library API, see the [wiki](https://github.com/bmwcarit/barefoot/wiki#hmm-map-matching), or via REST-like APIs provided with the stand-alone servers (matcher and tracker servers), see below or the [wiki](https://github.com/bmwcarit/barefoot/wiki#stand-alone-servers). This map matching solution covers both, online and offline map matching:

* **Offline map matching**: Most map matching applications rely on the matching of a sequence of position measurements recorded in the past (traces) for reconstruction of the object's path on the map. Offline map matching finds the best matching  on the map and exploits availability of the full trace.
* **Online map matching**: In many other applications, objects send position updates to some monitoring system periodically. An online map matching system matches each position update right away and, hence, keeps track of the objects' movements on the map in (near) real-time.

Accuracy of map matching depends mostly on the quality and quantity of input data, which consists of a sequence of measurement samples over time (including position measurement). Samples are submitted as a whole sequence for offline map matching or one after another for online map matching. A single sample includes the following information:

* **time** of the measurement sample which is given in unix time.
* **position** of the object (point in space, e.g. GPS measurement).
* **heading** of the object (azimuth measurement) which is optional and, if available, increases map matching accuracy.

#### Matcher server (Quick Start)

    ```

    *Note: To detach the interactive shell from a running container without stopping it, use the escape sequence Ctrl-p + Ctrl-q.*

6. Make sure the container is running ("up").

    ``` bash
    sudo docker ps -a
    ...
    ```

    *Note: The output of the last command should show status 'Up x seconds'.*

##### Matcher server

    SUCCESS
    ...
    ```

    *Note: On success, i.e. result code is SUCCESS, the output can be visualized with [http://geojson.io/](http://geojson.io/) and should show the same path as in the figure above. Otherwise, result code is either TIMEOUT or ERROR.*

#### Tracker server (Quick Start)

Online (real-time) map matching of a GPS trace in Munich city area with most likely position (blue dot) and alternative possible positions and routes (green dots and paths with transparency according to their probability). Alternative positions and routes disappear with continuously processed updates, which shows the principle of online map matching converging alternatives over time.

    ```

    *Note: On success, i.e. result code is SUCCESS, the tracking is visible in the browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Otherwise, result code is either TIMEOUT or ERROR.*

### Spatial search and operations

#### Spatial operations

A straight line between two points, here Reykjavik (green marker) and Moskva (blue marker), on the earth surface is  a geodesic (orange). The closest point on a geodesic to another point, here Berlin (violet marker), is referred to as the interception point (red marker).

<p align="center">
<img src="doc-files/com/bmwcarit/barefoot/spatial/intercept-satellite.png" width="700">
<br/>
<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/">&#xA9; Mapbox</a> <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">&#xA9; OpenStreetMap</a> <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/map-feedback/"><b>Improve this map</b></a> <a href="https://www.digitalglobe.com/">&#xA9; DigitalGlobe</a> <a href="http://geojson.io">&#xA9; geojson.io</a>
</p>

``` java
import com.bmwcarit.barefoot.spatial.Geography;
import com.bmwcarit.barefoot.spatial.SpatialOperator;

import com.esri.core.geometry.Point;

SpatialOperator spatial = new Geography();

Point reykjavik = new Point(-21.933333, 64.15);
Point moskva = new Point(37.616667, 55.75);
Point berlin = new Point(13.408056, 52.518611);

double f = spatial.intercept(reykjavik, moskva, berlin);
Point interception = spatial.interpolate(reykjavik, moskva, f);
```

Other spatial operations and formats provided with GeographicLib and ESRI Geometry API:

* Geodesics on ellipsoid of rotation (lines on earth surface)
* Calculation of distances, interception, intersection, etc.
* WKT (well-known-text) import/export
* GeoJSON import/export
* Geometric operations (convex hull, overlap, contains, etc.)
* Quad-tree spatial index

#### Spatial search

Spatial search in the road map requires access to spatial data of the road map and spatial operations for distance and point-to-line projection. Barefoot implements the following basic search operations:

* radius
* nearest
* k-nearest (kNN)

The following code snippet shows a radius search given a certain map:

``` java
import com.bmwcarit.barefoot.roadmap.Loader;
import com.bmwcarit.barefoot.roadmap.Road;
import com.bmwcarit.barefoot.roadmap.RoadMap;

import com.esri.core.geometry.GeometryEngine;

RoadMap map = Loader.roadmap("config/oberbayern.properties", true).construct();

Point c = new Point(11.550474464893341, 48.034123185269095);
double r = 50; // radius search within 50 meters
Set<RoadPoint> points = map.spatial().radius(c, r);

for (RoadPoint point : points) {
 GeometryEngine.geometryToGeoJson(point.geometry()));
 GeometryEngine.geometryToGeoJson(point.edge().geometry()));
}
```

A radius search, given a center point (red marker), returns road segments (colored lines) with their closest points (colored markers) on the road.

</p>

### Simple routing (Dijkstra)

TBD.

### Spatial cluster analysis

Spatial cluster analysis aggregates point data to high density clusters for detecting e.g. points of interest like frequent start and end points of trips. For that purpose, Barefoot includes a DBSCAN implementation for simple density-based spatial cluster analysis, which is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. For details, see the [wiki](https://github.com/bmwcarit/barefoot/wiki#spatial-cluster-analysis).

The following code snippet shows the simple usage of the algorithm:

``` java
import com.bmwcarit.barefoot.analysis.DBSCAN;

import com.esri.core.geometry.GeometryEngine;
import com.esri.core.geometry.MultiPoint;
import com.esri.core.geometry.Point;

List<Point> points = new LinkedList<Point>();
...
// DBSCAN algorithm with radius neighborhood of 100 and minimum density of 10
Set<List<Point>> clusters = DBSCAN.cluster(points, 100, 10);

for (List<Point> cluster : clusters) {
 MultiPoint multipoint = new MultiPoint();
 for (Point point : cluster) {
  multipoint.add(point);
 }
 GeometryEngine.geometryToGeoJson(multipoint);
}
```

As an example, the figure below shows typical locations for standing times of a New York City taxi driver (hack license BA96DE419E711691B9445D6A6307C170) derived by spatial cluster analysis of start and end points of all trips in January 2013. For details on the data set, see below.
